## About

Chatto is a fun AI (Artifical Intelligence) Discord chat bot. He'll try his best to respond to your messages in the given channel in the `Bot/Config.json` file. You can change that channel, by going into the file mentioned above, and change the value of `ChatChannel`, to your channel name. By default it's set to `chat`. That means if you're not hosting the bot yourself, you need to create a channel called `chat`.

> The bot is made for: Discord Hack Week
